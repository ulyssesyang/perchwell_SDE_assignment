101 East 63rd St,,38500000,Perm Off Mkt,"Incomparable. Groundbreaking. Emulated. Iconic. Legendary.These words describe not only the spectacular architecture of 101 East 63rd Street, but the figures associated with it: Paul Rudolph, Halston, Gianni Agnelli and Gunter Sachs. Now, for the first time in generations, this unadulterated gem of architectural history and heirloom of 20th century New York's golden age of art and culture is available for purchase. Rudolph had already served as Dean of the Yale School of Architecture and achieved international acclaim when he built the house in 1966. His clients wanted an ""urban retreat,"" and thus, Rudolph constructed a facade of steel and glass which purposefully demurs to its more traditional neighbors.  Step inside, however, and the space comes to life, surprising and delighting guests with its unconventional use of space and light. An understated slate entry hall explodes into the vast expanse of a living room with 32' ceilings and skylights. A double-height master suite, bamboo garden and floating staircase delight. On the top floor an additional living room, kitchen and 2nd master suite are complemented by a 1,600 s/f terrace. A garage provides the ultimate in privacy and security. All told, there are 4 bedrooms, 3 living rooms, a dining room, study, 2 kitchens, terrace and solarium. As Rudolph intended when he completed this as his only complete residential townhouse in Manhattan, and as Halston, Agnelli and Sachs all agreed, this home is truly without equal.",0,0,Townhouse,0,,sammy.simpson@corciman.com,

The ingenious original design split the town home into two sections placed in the front and back of the 100 foot lot, with glass-enclosed connecting ramps and an atrium between.   Continuing in the innovative tradition of Mr. Fairchild, the mansion was given new life by the present owners with a complete renovation.  The walls dividing the atrium were taken down creating a colossal great room rising up four stories to a spectacular skylight that encompasses almost the entire roof.  Presently the home of renowned art dealership French & Company, this masterwork of post-modern ingenuity is perfect for displaying a major art collection.

The approved plans allow for the removal of an entry door and a staircase, the creation of an elegant, spacious entry gallery and of an, almost square, architecturally significant, 24'x 20 living room with 19' ceiling height and a wood burning fireplace centered on the east wall. The views from this room are intoxicating with a huge artist's window to the north. Included in the plan was a 20'x 27' kitchen/family/dining room south and west. Upstairs one could create two generous bedrooms and two new baths. The building allows all new windows throughout and central air. One could use the same plan or an iteration of it. Any new plans would be subject to the approval process.  Would have to go through the approval process again, but we know the combination would be approved and the new windows, kitchen, baths, new staircase and central air should be as well.

408 5th Ave,,3500000,Temp Off Mkt,"Rare mixed use building now available in the center of Park Slope.  Home for the last decade to Rachel's, one of the neighborhood's most popular restaurants, 408 5th Avenue stands out for its exceptional income potential.   Not only does the building house a fully-complemented restaurant--able to earn the highest retail income the market will allow--it also boasts two extremely large floor-through apartments of nearly 1000 sq ft each.  In addition there is another 1500 sq ft of build-able square footage on the lot, allowing for a permanent extension of the commercial space as well as another floor to the building.  The excellent location is two blocks from multiple trains, two blocks from the core of the Gowanus art scene, and squarely in the middle of one of Brooklyn's most established neighborhoods and busiest retail corridors.    Owner-occupied, the commercial space and the second floor will be delivered vacant, and the top floor tenant is month-to-month.     This would allow a new owner to  rent anew at the top of the market.  The apartments need cosmetic upgrades, but potentially could garner $50 ppsf.  Commercial spaces  in this area often ask over $90 ppsf.  The potential cap rate is well above the Brooklyn norm, from 5.27% to 6.10% with upgrades.

7 East 67th St,,28500000,Sold,"UNDISCOVERED TREASURE - One definition of genius is the ability to look at what is in front of everyone in a new way, to see inherent value that others pass up.  VALUE DEFINED - Three irreplaceable elements define value in a Manhattan townhouse.  First, a Fifth to Madison Avenue location as there is no more valuable corridor on the Upper East Side with its immediate access to Fifth Avenue and the 843 acres of Central Park. Second is width and this townhouse features an exquisite 25 feet of frontage.  Third is a classic limestone facade in the Beaux-Arts style. This mansion has all three. ARCHITECT'S ROWIn the early years of the 20th Century, this park block saw a major transformation.  Brownstone was replaced by shimmering limestone, and Queen Anne by the lavish Beaux-Arts style. New facades and interior designs were commissioned by the finest architects of the time: John Duncan, CPH Gilbert, James Gamble Rogers, Carrere & Hastings, Ernst Flagg, and Clinton and Russell who designed this house, in addition to The Flatiron building and numerous commissions for the Astor family.  THE MANSION TODAYUsing The M Group, the previous owner completed a gut renovation extending over several years and the current owners have added exquisite refinements and upgrades in the years following.  A complete detailing of all systems is available upon request. This residence contains 19 rooms with 7 bedrooms, 7 full baths, 3 half baths, and 11 working fireplaces. There are entertaining spaces of exceptional beauty and scale with 12'6"" ceilings on the parlor floor, elegant private areas, staff quarters, a gym, as well as a wine cellar.  The elevatored building contains approximately 11,550 interior square feet including 1,971 square feet in the finished basement and 2,217 exterior square feet including the patio off the breakfast room, the terrace off the library, and a landscaped roof terrace with views toward Central Park.  EXCEPTIONAL DESIGN FEATURESThere is an extraordinary curved staircase that ascends upward for five levels and is capped by a skylight enabling light to pour into the building.  A secondary staircase is a work of art in wrought iron with walls of glass  an veritable interior sculpture -  that affords access to the upper floors while providing  a column of light in the rear of the building.  The floating main staircase and the interior rear glass stair were intentionally created to bring light into normally darker areas within a large residence.  Further, there is a north-facing library that is double-heighted with 20-foot-tall Palladian windows, undisputedly one of the great residential rooms in New York. The library opens to one of the most exquisite terraces with a fireplace.  7 East 67th Street is the most exquisitely renovated mansion available on the market today: with a 25 foot wide limestone Beaux-Arts facade on a notable Central Park block close to Fifth Avenue, this residence exceeds the criteria for irreplaceable value in a New York Townhouse.Co-Exclusive",7.5,7,Townhouse,11550,19,sammy.simpson@corciman.com,daren.dechter@corciman.com
